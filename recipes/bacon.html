        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Baking bacon at 350 degrees F is the way to get crisp bacon without having to constantly turn it, watch over it, or get burnt by splatters of grease.</p>
        <p>It "fries" up flat and doesn't curl, which looks great beside a breakfast plate of eggs, and makes BLT sandwiches much easier. Very nice when feeding a family or crowd.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound thick sliced bacon</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Arrange the bacon in a single layer on the prepared sheet with the edges touching or slightly overlapping.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven to desired degree of doneness, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove bacon from the baking sheet with tongs or a fork, and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        </ol>
